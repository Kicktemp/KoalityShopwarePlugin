# koality.io Shopware Plugin

This plugin can be used to continuously monitor a Shopware shop for business metrics. 

## Metrics

The following metrics are implemented yet:

- **Minimum orders per hour** - this check fails if the number of orders within the last hour falls under a given threshold. 


- **Maximum number of open carts** - fails if there are to many open carts. This often happens if the payment fails, and the customers can't finish the buying process.
